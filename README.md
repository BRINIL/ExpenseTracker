# EXPENSE TRACKER
## Here a **GUI based** basic expense tracker that keeps a track of the expenses incurred during a time frame has been constructed using NetBeans.
There are **three modules** in this project: Add expenses page, Category page and Spendings page.
The working is as follows:
* Initially, when we go to the main page, which is *Add Expenses* page, we haveb  the option of adding a new expense(Date, amount and category).
If we are adding an expense that does not fall under any of the pre-defined categories, we have the option to add category.
* On clicking the option *Add new category*. This will redirect us to a new page 'Add Categories', where we can add new categories. If we wish to remove some of the categories, we can do so by clicking 'remove'.
* Then nextly, we have a page *View Spendings*, where we have the flexibility to view our expenses date wise and category wise(with a user selected time frame).
